# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to contribute
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch
- Keep changes small and focused
- Add/adjust tests if public behavior changes
- Ensure the app runs and jobs start
- Open a Pull Request describing the change and rationale

## Code style
- Python 3.8+
- Prefer clear, simple code; add docstrings for public methods
- Keep configuration and secrets out of code; use environment variables

## Commit messages
- Conventional-ish: feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, test

## Reporting issues
- Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and logs where possible

## Security
- If you find a vulnerability, please follow `SECURITY.md`.
